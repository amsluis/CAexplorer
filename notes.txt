Initial Conditions
* Single center seed
* Random (with variable threshold)
* Sparse
 - no adjacent live cells (i.e. for ECA73)
 - control overall density
* Higher-order structure
 - density of live cells varies, more dense near center
 - arithmetic sequences


CA modes
* Elementary CAs
* Totalistic
* Outer Totalistic
